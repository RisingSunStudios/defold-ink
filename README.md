# defold-ink

The [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) language parser and runtime implementation in Lua.

Just a proof of concept, based on parsing [JSON](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/ink_JSON_runtime_format.md) files. 

Not production ready, use [Narrator](https://github.com/astrochili/narrator) instead. Or contribute :)
